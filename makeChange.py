    return a lazy iterator. These are objects that you can loop over like a list. However, 
    unlike lists, lazy iterators do not store their contents in memory.'''

''' 
- Yield: The yield statement is what turns a function into a generator. It provides the value to the caller and "pauses" the functionâ€™s state until the next value is requested.
- Lazy evaluation: Generators compute values on the fly, which helps with memory efficiency.
- State retention: Unlike normal functions, generators maintain their state between calls, meaning the local variables and where it left off are remembered.
- StopIteration exception: A generator raises this when there are no more values to yield.
